# Chat-Application
NodeJs, MongoDB, Socket.io
Built a chat application featuring user account creation, real-time messaging, emoji integration, and secure logout. Utilized the MERN stack and Socket.io to ensure seamless communication between users..

Choice of Technologies and Tools Used:
	Frontend: React, chosen for its component-based architecture, ease of use, and efficient DOM manipulation.
	Backend: Node.js with Express for handling HTTP requests, and Socket.IO to enable WebSocket communication.
	Database: MongoDB or Firebase for managing user information (if persistence is needed).
Additional Libraries: Axios for HTTP requests, CORS for cross-origin resource sharing, and dotenv for environment variables.
